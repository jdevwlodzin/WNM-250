                    <p>You will create a single web page for a store. Your store must present 
                    at least 12 products. Each product must have a name, picture, price, and a short
                    description.</p>

                    <p>You can choose any subject you want for the store. It can sell any type of 
                    product that you want to work with. Do your best to fully conceive your site. 
                    Include a logo, and footer. Look at some sites that you shop at for inspiration. 
                    Ask yourself what these sites include, and why.</p>

                    <p>Create a single page with a fluid design. Your finsihed page should look
                    good at screen sizes for desktop, tablet and mobile devices. Pay close 
                    attention to font sizes on smaller screens. Use the inspector in Chrome to 
                    test at mobile screen sizes, or test on your own mobile device!</p>

                    <p>Use all of the ideas from class. Use only class names for your styles.
                    Do not use id names. Use contextual tags, like section and aritcle. Do not add 
                    class names to these tags. Add class names to div, and other tags. </p>
                    
                    <p>Use media queries to create styles that adpt for mobile. Use the ideas from 
                    class. </p>
